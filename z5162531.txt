Rebecca Diaz (z5162531) Diary

--week 1--
I created a jira board for the team and a google doc for our project proposal.
We had team meeting and chose our project - Recruit Assistant.
We also decided on using python for the backend and React for the frontend.
I created some user stories for the product backlog, and outlined 
possible pages for our website.

--week 2---
I created wireframes along with Cattleya using Balsamiq including: employer dashboard, job seeker dashboard,
create new job advert pages, login and sign up pages, and admin pages to delete jobs or users.
